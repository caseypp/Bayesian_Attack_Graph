The files in this directory provide two packages:

1) PNLtoGraphviz Package (vizualization of network graphs); 

2) LinkConnectionStrength Package (calculates connection strength between nodes and link strength of arcs for Discrete Bayesian Networks).


REQUIRED FILES:
===============
   * PNLtoGraphviz.hpp  
   * PNLtoGraphviz.cpp
   * LinkConnectionStrength.hpp
   * LinkConnectionStrength.cpp

Note: The two packages depend on each other, so you have to download all four files above, even if you only want to use one of the two packages.

OPTIONAL FILES:
===============
   * SampleUsePTG.cpp (Main file to demonstrate use of PNLtoGraphviz interface.)
   * SampleUseLCS.cpp (Main file to demonstrate use of LinkConnectionStrength package)
   * models.cpp  (various network models used as examples in SampleUse files)
   * models.h  (corresponding header file)
